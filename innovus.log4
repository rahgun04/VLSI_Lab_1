**ERROR: (IMPSYT-7327):	Active setup and hold analysis views were not provided in either file ./mmmc_timing.tcl or by the -setup and -hold arguments to initDesign. The system requires at least one active setup and hold analysis view to be declared before the design can be initialized. You must add a set_analysis_view command to your script, or add the -setup and -hold options to your init_design invocation. You can use the all_analysis_view command to identify the currently available views. If you are using CPF in a physical-only flow, please use 'read_power_intent -cpf' and 'commit_power_intent' after init_design. Do not specify the CPF with the init_cpf_file variable in a physical-only flow.
